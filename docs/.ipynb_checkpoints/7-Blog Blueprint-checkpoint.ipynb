    "Blog Blueprint¶\n",
    "You’ll use the same techniques you learned about when writing the authentication blueprint to write the blog blueprint. The blog should list all posts, allow logged in users to create posts, and allow the author of a post to edit or delete it.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you implement each view, keep the development server running. As you save your changes, try going to the URL in your browser and testing them out.\n",
    "\n",

    "    return app\n",
    "Unlike the auth blueprint, the blog blueprint does not have a url_prefix. So the index view will be at /, the create view at /create, and so on. The blog is the main feature of Flaskr, so it makes sense that the blog index will be the main index.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the endpoint for the index view defined below will be blog.index. Some of the authentication views referred to a plain index endpoint. app.add_url_rule() associates the endpoint name 'index' with the / url so that url_for('index') or url_for('blog.index') will both work, generating the same / URL either way.\n",
    "\n",
    "In another application you might give the blog blueprint a url_prefix and define a separate index view in the application factory, similar to the hello view. Then the index and blog.index endpoints and URLs would be different.\n",

Flask will capture the 1, ensure it’s an int, and pass it as the id argument. If you don’t specify int: and instead do <id>, it will be a string.
