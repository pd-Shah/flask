    "When using SQLAlchemy with Flask, the standard approach is to use the Flask-SQLAlchemy extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this extension has some issues. In particular, we have to use a base class for our sqlalchemy models that creates a dependency on flask (via flask_sqlalchemy.SQLAlchemy.db.Model). Also, an application may not require the additional functionality that the extension provides, such as pagination support.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see if we can find a way to use plain SQLAlchemy in our Flask applications without relying on this extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the code that sets up the SQLAlchemy session (db.py):\n",
    "\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "from sqlalchemy import create_engine\n",
    "\n",
    "from sqlalchemy.orm import scoped_session\n",

    "\n",
    "engine = create_engine(os.environ['SQLALCHEMY_URL'])\n",
    "\n",
    "Session = scoped_session(sessionmaker(bind=engine))\n",
    "The key here is scoped_session: Now when we use Session, SQLAlchemy will check to see if a thread-local session exists. If it already exists, then it will use it, otherwise it will create one first.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code bootstraps the Flask application (__init__.py):\n",
    "\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "from .db import Session\n",
    "\n",
    "from .hello import hello_blueprint\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "@app.teardown_appcontext\n",
    "def cleanup(resp_or_exc):\n",
    "    Session.remove()\n",
    "The @app.teardown_appcontext decorator will cause the supplied callback, cleanup, to be executed when the current application context is torn down. This happens after each request. That way we make sure to release the resources used by a session after each request.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our Flask application, we can now use Session to interact with our database. For example (hello.py):\n",
    "\n",
    "import json\n",
    "\n",
    "from flask import Blueprint\n",
    "\n",
    "from .db import Session\n",

    "\n",
    "    return (json.dumps(results), 200, { 'content_type': 'application/json' })\n",
    "If we just need session management without the other features that Flask-SQLAlchemy provides, such as pagination, signalling events (SQLAlchemy has its own anyway), driver hacks, SQLAlchemy configuration via Flask, and a few others, then this code should be sufficient for integrating SQLAlchemy into a Flask application.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more detailed overview of the features Flask-SQLAlchemy provides, see Derrick Gilland's article, Demystifying Flask-SQLAlchemy\n",
    "\n",
    "We also get the benefit of not having to create a dependency on Flask for our SQLAlchemy models. Below we're just using the standard sqlalchemy.ext.declarative.declarative_base (models.py):\n",

    "\n",
    "    def __repr__(self):\n",
    "        return \"<Message(message='%s')>\" % (self.message)\n",
    "I could be wrong, but I would prefer to start a project with this approach initially, and only to incorporate the Flask-SQLAlchemy extension later if it turns out to be demonstrably useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also my feeling that the extension is not as modular as it could be. Maybe in the future it will be refactored in such as way as to separate out independent concerns and to remove the need for the SQLAlchemy models to be tightly coupled to the Flask framework."

    "Generally Flask-SQLAlchemy behaves like a properly configured declarative base from the declarative extension. As such we recommend reading the SQLAlchemy docs for a full reference. However the most common use cases are also documented here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "The baseclass for all your models is called db.Model. It’s stored on the SQLAlchemy instance you have to create. See Quickstart for more details.\n",
    "Some parts that are required in SQLAlchemy are optional in Flask-SQLAlchemy. For instance the table name is automatically set for you unless overridden. It’s derived from the class name converted to lowercase and with “CamelCase” converted to “camel_case”. To override the table name, set the __tablename__ class attribute.\n",
    "Simple Example\n",
    "A very simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class User(db.Model):\n",
    "    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n",
    "    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)\n",
    "    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __repr__(self):\n",
    "        return '<User %r>' % self.username\n",
    "Use Column to define a column. The name of the column is the name you assign it to. If you want to use a different name in the table you can provide an optional first argument which is a string with the desired column name. Primary keys are marked with primary_key=True. Multiple keys can be marked as primary keys in which case they become a compound primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "The types of the column are the first argument to Column. You can either provide them directly or call them to further specify them (like providing a length). The following types are the most common:\n",
    "\n",
    "Integer\tan integer\n",
    "String(size)\ta string with a maximum length (optional in some databases, e.g. PostgreSQL)\n",
    "Text\tsome longer unicode text\n",
    "DateTime\tdate and time expressed as Python datetime object.\n",
    "Float\tstores floating point values\n",
    "Boolean\tstores a boolean value\n",
    "PickleType\tstores a pickled Python object\n",
    "LargeBinary\tstores large arbitrary binary data\n",
    "One-to-Many Relationships\n",
    "The most common relationships are one-to-many relationships. Because relationships are declared before they are established you can use strings to refer to classes that are not created yet (for instance if Person defines a relationship to Address which is declared later in the file).\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationships are expressed with the relationship() function. However the foreign key has to be separately declared with the ForeignKey class:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person(db.Model):\n",
    "    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n",
    "    name = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)\n",
    "    addresses = db.relationship('Address', backref='person', lazy=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "class Address(db.Model):\n",
    "    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n",
    "    email = db.Column(db.String(120), nullable=False)\n",
    "    person_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('person.id'),\n",
    "        nullable=False)\n",
    "What does db.relationship() do? That function returns a new property that can do multiple things. In this case we told it to point to the Address class and load multiple of those. How does it know that this will return more than one address? Because SQLAlchemy guesses a useful default from your declaration. If you would want to have a one-to-one relationship you can pass uselist=False to relationship().\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a person with no name or an email address with no address associated makes no sense, nullable=False tells SQLAlchemy to create the column as NOT NULL. This is implied for primary key columns, but it’s a good idea to specify it for all other columns to make it clear to other people working on your code that you did actually want a nullable column and did not just forget to add it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what do backref and lazy mean? backref is a simple way to also declare a new property on the Address class. You can then also use my_address.person to get to the person at that address. lazy defines when SQLAlchemy will load the data from the database:\n",
    "\n",
    "'select' / True (which is the default, but explicit is better than implicit) means that SQLAlchemy will load the data as necessary in one go using a standard select statement.\n",
    "'joined' / False tells SQLAlchemy to load the relationship in the same query as the parent using a JOIN statement.\n",
    "'subquery' works like 'joined' but instead SQLAlchemy will use a subquery.\n",
    "'dynamic' is special and can be useful if you have many items and always want to apply additional SQL filters to them. Instead of loading the items SQLAlchemy will return another query object which you can further refine before loading the items. Note that this cannot be turned into a different loading strategy when querying so it’s often a good idea to avoid using this in favor of lazy=True. A query object equivalent to a dynamic user.addresses relationship can be created using Address.query.with_parent(user) while still being able to use lazy or eager loading on the relationship itself as necessary.\n",
    "How do you define the lazy status for backrefs? By using the backref() function:\n",
    "\n",
    "class User(db.Model):\n",
    "    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n",
    "    name = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)\n",
    "    addresses = db.relationship('Address', lazy='select',\n",
    "        backref=db.backref('person', lazy='joined'))\n",
    "Many-to-Many Relationships\n",
    "If you want to use many-to-many relationships you will need to define a helper table that is used for the relationship. For this helper table it is strongly recommended to not use a model but an actual table:\n",
    "\n",
    "tags = db.Table('tags',\n",
    "    db.Column('tag_id', db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('tag.id'), primary_key=True),\n",
    "    db.Column('page_id', db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('page.id'), primary_key=True)\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Page(db.Model):\n",
    "    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n",
    "    tags = db.relationship('Tag', secondary=tags, lazy='subquery',\n",
    "        backref=db.backref('pages', lazy=True))\n",
    "\n",
    "class Tag(db.Model):\n",
    "    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n",
    "Here we configured Page.tags to be loaded immediately after loading a Page, but using a separate query. This always results in two queries when retrieving a Page, but when querying for multiple pages you will not get additional queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The list of pages for a tag on the other hand is something that’s rarely needed. For example, you won’t need that list when retrieving the tags for a specific page. Therefore, the backref is set to be lazy-loaded so that accessing it for the first time will trigger a query to get the list of pages for that tag. If you need to apply further query options on that list, you could either switch to the 'dynamic' strategy - with the drawbacks mentioned above - or get a query object using Page.query.with_parent(some_tag) and then use it exactly as you would with the query object from a dynamic relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Select, Insert, Delete\n",
    "http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/2.3/queries/\n",
    "Now that you have declared models it’s time to query the data from the database. We will be using the model definitions from the Quickstart chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inserting Records\n",
    "Before we can query something we will have to insert some data. All your models should have a constructor, so make sure to add one if you forgot. Constructors are only used by you, not by SQLAlchemy internally so it’s entirely up to you how you define them.\n",

    "Inserting data into the database is a three step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the Python object\n",
    "Add it to the session\n",
    "Commit the session\n",
    "The session here is not the Flask session, but the Flask-SQLAlchemy one. It is essentially a beefed up version of a database transaction. This is how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> from yourapp import User\n",
    ">>> me = User('admin', 'admin@example.com')\n",
    ">>> db.session.add(me)\n",
    ">>> db.session.commit()\n",
    "Alright, that was not hard. What happens at what point? Before you add the object to the session, SQLAlchemy basically does not plan on adding it to the transaction. That is good because you can still discard the changes. For example think about creating the post at a page but you only want to pass the post to the template for preview rendering instead of storing it in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The add() function call then adds the object. It will issue an INSERT statement for the database but because the transaction is still not committed you won’t get an ID back immediately. If you do the commit, your user will have an ID:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> me.id\n",
    "1\n",
    "Deleting Records\n",
    "Deleting records is very similar, instead of add() use delete():\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> db.session.delete(me)\n",
    ">>> db.session.commit()\n",
    "Querying Records\n",
    "So how do we get data back out of our database? For this purpose Flask-SQLAlchemy provides a query attribute on your Model class. When you access it you will get back a new query object over all records. You can then use methods like filter() to filter the records before you fire the select with all() or first(). If you want to go by primary key you can also use get().\n",
    "\n",
