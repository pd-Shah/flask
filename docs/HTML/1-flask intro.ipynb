    "1. Flask is a micro web framework written in Python and based on the Werkzeug toolkit and Jinja2 template engine. It is BSD licensed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Werkzeug(WSGI library) is like a communicator between your python code and http nginx/apache server\n",
    "\n",
    "> Jinja2 is a modern and designer-friendly templating language for Python, modelled after Django’s templates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is called a micro framework because\n",
    "\n",
    "1. it does not require particular tools or libraries. \n",
    "2. It has no database abstraction layer, \n",
    "3. form validation, \n",
    "4. any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Pirates use Flask, the Navy uses Django\n",
    "2. NoSQL DataBase + Internet of Things + RESTFull\n",
    "\n",
    "## NoSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL is a new breed of database management systems that fundamentally differ from relational database systems. These databases do not require tables with a fixed set of columns, avoid JOINs and typically support horizontal scaling. They are also referred to as structured storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Does Django support NoSQL databases?\n",
    "NoSQL databases are not officially supported by Django itself. There are, however, a number of side project and forks which allow NoSQL functionality in Django, like Django non-rel.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also take a look on the wiki page which discusses some alternatives.\n",
    "## MongoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "This highly scalable and agile NoSQL database is a amazing performing system. This open source database written in C++ comes with a storage that is document oriented. Also, you will be provided with benefits like full index support, high availability across WANs and LANs along with easy replication, horizontal scaling, rich queries that are document based, flexibility in data processing and aggregation along with proper training, support and consultation.\n",

    "<img src='pics/1*xu1Ge_Cew0DHdSU6ETcpLQ.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Microservices Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to split your application into a set of smaller, interconnected services instead of building a single monolithic application. Each microservice is a small application that has its own hexagonal architecture consisting of business logic along with various adapters. Some microservices would expose a REST, RPC or message-based API and most services consume APIs provided by other services. Other microservices might implement a web UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flask, micro framework  !! Microservices Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "“Micro” does not mean that your whole web application has to fit into a single Python file (although it certainly can), nor does it mean that Flask is lacking in functionality. The “micro” in microframework means Flask aims to keep the core simple but extensible. Flask won’t make many decisions for you, such as what database to use. Those decisions that it does make, such as what templating engine to use, are easy to change. Everything else is up to you, so that Flask can be everything you need and nothing you don’t.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Flask does not include a database abstraction layer, form validation or anything else where different libraries already exist that can handle that. Instead, Flask supports extensions to add such functionality to your application as if it was implemented in Flask itself. Numerous extensions provide database integration, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies, and more. Flask may be “micro”, but it’s ready for production use on a variety of needs.\n",
