    "\n",
    "The application will use a SQLite database to store users and posts. Python comes with built-in support for SQLite in the sqlite3 module.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite is convenient because it doesn’t require setting up a separate database server and is built-in to Python. However, if concurrent requests try to write to the database at the same time, they will slow down as each write happens sequentially. Small applications won’t notice this. Once you become big, you may want to switch to a different database.\n",

    "# Connect to the Database\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to do when working with a SQLite database (and most other Python database libraries) is to create a connection to it. Any queries and operations are performed using the connection, which is closed after the work is finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "In web applications this connection is typically tied to the request. It is created at some point when handling a request, and closed before the response is sent."

Setting it makes the sqlite3 module parse the declared type for each column it returns. It will parse out the first word of the declared type, i. e. for “integer primary key”, it will parse out “integer”, or for “number(10)” it will parse out “number”. Then for that column, it will look into the converters dictionary and use the converter function registered for that type there.\n",
