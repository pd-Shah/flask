    "## Database\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically modeled in rows and columns in a series of tables to make processing and data querying efficient. The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized. Most databases use structured query language (SQL) for writing and querying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## different types of databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different types of databases. The best database for a specific organization depends on how the organization intends to use the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Relational databases. Relational databases became dominant in the 1980s. Items in a relational database are organized as a set of tables with columns and rows. Relational database technology provides the most efficient and flexible way to access structured information.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Object-oriented databases. Information in an object-oriented database is represented in the form of objects, as in object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Distributed databases. A distributed database consists of two or more files located in different sites. The database may be stored on multiple computers, located in the same physical location, or scattered over different networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data warehouses. A central repository for data, a data warehouse is a type of database specifically designed for fast query and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. NoSQL databases. A NoSQL, or nonrelational database, allows unstructured and semistructured data to be stored and manipulated (in contrast to a relational database, which defines how all data inserted into the database must be composed). NoSQL databases grew popular as web applications became more common and more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Graph databases. A graph database stores data in terms of entities and the relationships between entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. OLTP databases. An OLTP database is a speedy, analytic database designed for large numbers of transactions performed by multiple users.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Most common databases for Python web apps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. PostgreSQL and MySQL are two of the most common open source databases for storing Python web applications' data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. SQLite is a database that is stored in a single file on disk. SQLite is built into Python but is only built for access by a single connection at a time. Therefore is highly recommended to not run a production web application with SQLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/databases.jpg\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connecting to a database with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with a relational database using Python, you need to use a code library. The most common libraries for relational databases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. psycopg2 for PostgreSQL.\n",
    "2. MySQLdb for MySQL. Note that this driver's development is mostly frozen so evaluating alternative drivers is wise if you are using MySQL as a backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "## NoSQL Data Stores\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational databases store the vast majority of web application persistent data. However, there are several alternative classifications of storage representations.\n",

    "The new Post class will represent blog posts written by users. The timestamp field is going to be indexed, which is useful if you want to retrieve posts in chronological order. I have also added a default argument, and passed the datetime.utcnow function. When you pass a function as a default, SQLAlchemy will set the field to the value of calling that function (note that I did not include the () after utcnow, so I'm passing the function itself, and not the result of calling it). In general, you will want to work with UTC dates and times in a server application. This ensures that you are using uniform timestamps regardless of where the users are located. These timestamps will be converted to the user's local time when they are displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user_id field was initialized as a foreign key to user.id, which means that it references an id value from the users table. In this reference the user part is the name of the database table for the model. It is an unfortunate inconsistency that in some instances such as in a db.relationship() call, the model is referenced by the model class, which typically starts with an uppercase character, while in other cases such as this db.ForeignKey() declaration, a model is given by its database table name, for which SQLAlchemy automatically uses lowercase characters and, for multi-word model names, snake case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The User class has a new posts field, that is initialized with db.relationship. This is not an actual database field, but a high-level view of the relationship between users and posts, and for that reason it isn't in the database diagram. For a one-to-many relationship, a db.relationship field is normally defined on the \"one\" side, and is used as a convenient way to get access to the \"many\". So for example, if I have a user stored in u, the expression u.posts will run a database query that returns all the posts written by that user. The first argument to db.relationship is the model class that represents the \"many\" side of the relationship. This argument can be provided as a string with the class name if the model is defined later in the module. The backref argument defines the name of a field that will be added to the objects of the \"many\" class that points back at the \"one\" object. This will add a post.author expression that will return the user given a post. The lazy argument defines how the database query for the relationship will be issued, which is something that I will discuss later. Don't worry if these details don't make much sense just yet, I'll show you examples of this at the end of this article.\n",
